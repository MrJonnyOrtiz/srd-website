                  Modernizing your home: ideas for a contemporary remodel.

               <p class="fs-4">
                  If you're looking to modernize your home and give it a fresh
                  new look, a contemporary remodel may be just what you need. A
                  contemporary remodel can update your home's style and increase
                  its functionality while creating a more comfortable and
                  inviting living space. Here are some ideas to consider when
                  modernizing your home with a contemporary remodel.

                        <strong>Open Concept Design:</strong> Contemporary
                        design often features an open concept layout, which
                        removes walls and barriers to create a more expansive
                        and connected living space. This can be achieved by
                        opening up the kitchen to the living room, removing
                        walls between adjacent rooms, or creating a large
                        central living area. At Sarasota Remodeling, our
                        designers will measure your space and provide you with a
                        completely redesigned floor plan of an open concept in
                        your home.

                        <strong>Minimalism:</strong> Contemporary design
                        embraces minimalism, using clean lines and simple shapes
                        to create a sleek and sophisticated look. To achieve
                        this, consider decluttering your home and getting rid of
                        any unnecessary furniture or decor. Use neutral colors
                        and textures, such as white, beige, or gray, to create a
                        calming and inviting atmosphere. Our designers will work
                        with you to achieve that minimalistic look and feel.

                        <strong>Lighting:</strong> Contemporary design often
                        incorporates natural light and modern lighting fixtures
                        to create a bright and airy living space. We can install
                        large windows or skylights to let in natural light, as
                        well as modern light fixtures such as pendant lights,
                        track lighting, or LED strips to illuminate your home's
                        interior.

                        <strong>Smart Home Technology:</strong> A contemporary
                        remodel can also incorporate smart home technology, such
                        as smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security
                        cameras. These features can help you control your home's
                        temperature, lighting, and security from your smartphone
                        or tablet, making your home more convenient and
                        energy-efficient. Weâ€™d love to upgrade you to the 21st
                        century technology!

                        <strong>Updated Appliances and Fixtures:</strong> One of
                        the most important aspects of a contemporary remodel is
                        updating your appliances and fixtures to modern,
                        energy-efficient models. This includes upgrading your
                        kitchen appliances, installing new bathroom fixtures,
                        and replacing outdated light fixtures and ceiling fans.

                        design also emphasizes sustainability and
                        eco-friendliness. We can install sustainable materials
                        such as bamboo flooring, recycled glass countertops, and
                        energy-efficient windows and doors to create a more
