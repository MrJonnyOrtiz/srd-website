               <p class="fs-4">
                  As people age, they may face challenges with mobility,
                  balance, accessibility, and safety in their homes.
                  Aging-in-place remodeling refers to the modifications made to
                  a home to make it more accommodating and accessible for
                  seniors. These modifications can help seniors live
                  independently and comfortably in their own homes for as long
                  as possible. We’re excited to share some remodeling ideas that
                  can help seniors live safely and comfortably in their own home
                  as part of our aging-in-place remodeling services.

                        <strong>Install grab bars and handrails</strong>
                        Installing grab bars and handrails in strategic
                        locations can greatly improve seniors' safety and
                        mobility. Grab bars can be installed in the bathroom
                        near the toilet and shower, and handrails can be
                        installed on stairs and hallways. These features provide
                        support, balance, and stability, making it easier for
                        seniors to navigate their homes.

                        <strong>Improve lighting</strong> Poor lighting can be
                        hazardous for seniors, especially those with poor
                        eyesight. Installing brighter and more energy-efficient
                        lighting fixtures can improve visibility and reduce the
                        risk of falls. With a little tech, we can install
                        motion-activated lights in hallways, bathrooms, and
                        other high-traffic areas.

                        <strong>Consider a walk-in bathtub or shower</strong>
                        A walk-in bathtub or shower can make bathing safer and
                        more comfortable for seniors. These features eliminate
                        the need to step over a high bathtub wall or climb into
                        a shower stall, reducing the risk of falls.
                        Additionally, adding a bench or seat inside the shower
                        can provide a comfortable place to sit while showering.

                        <strong>Replace doorknobs with lever handles</strong>
                        Doorknobs can be difficult to operate for seniors with
                        arthritis or limited hand mobility. Replacing doorknobs
                        with lever handles can make opening and closing doors
                        much easier. Lever handles can be operated with a gentle
                        push or pull, requiring less effort and pressure than
                        traditional doorknobs.

                        <strong>Consider a stairlift or elevator</strong> Stairs
                        can pose a challenge for seniors with mobility issues.
                        Installing a stairlift or elevator can make it easier
                        for seniors to move between floors of their home.
                        Stairlifts are installed on the stairs and can carry the
                        user up and down, while elevators are free-standing and
                        can travel between floors.
